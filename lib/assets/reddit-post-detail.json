I knew their son, Huntington Septien, for 10+ years and dropped out of contact with him for him to call me out of the blue to do “work” for their Entertainment Group despite us not talking for the past 3 years. When I showed up it was clear he had no idea what he was talking about and set up this project where he was sending a 15 year old client to Europe for a “tour” and had no audio engineer lined up to go with her or be there ready for them across the pond, so he commissioned a “gig box” for her so that she “wouldn’t need anyone once she got there.” Big mistake, I told him that a 15 year old and her mother may not be the best at managing their own gear. Didn’t listen to me, I kept showing up hoping to fulfill the contract because honestly I was doing a favor for an old friend. Linda Septien was personally overseeing the project and greenlit the idea, the shoddy execution, and the poor planning while charging the client for every unnecessary step along the way. I fulfilled my end of the bargain and was extremely upset with the quality and care brought forth to these people and said it was reckless to send a child out like that with shitty equipment and no sound guy. They said it was great and they loved my work. \n\nThat is until the time to pay came at least. My “friend” Huntington ignored my numerous phone calls, he ignored my texts, left my messages on social media on read, and never replied to my voicemails. I call the studio and talk to a receptionist who says to leave a voicemail with Carl the accountant, which I do and is never answered. I call the next week and a different receptionist says Carl doesn’t work on Mondays. I call Wednesday and their receptionist says Carl doesn’t work at Septien any longer. I call back the next week and talk to Jeff who says he remembers me, that he will write a check, and that I had to learn how to talk to people. Jeff also never sent any check. 32 days passed before I even heard from him and all he said was “Oh, the check is in the mail, come to the studio to talk about it.” I informed him that there was nothing to talk about, I completed my end of the work and needed to get paid. This is right after I graduated college and needed the money badly. This is when Linda herself stepped in to say that SEG was not responsible for my payment and it was a civil issue between me and my friend. Carl, who allegedly didn’t work there anymore, and Jeff were both in the email chain regarding them saying they weren’t going to pay me. 28 more days pass and no money shows up, in the meantime I get a new job at a great audio company in the area and decide to call him and his mother scam artists, horrible people, and embarrassments to the entertainment industry. Guess what shows up later that week? My check in full, 55 days AFTER the payment deadline. **After arriving at my new job my manager asked me about working for Septien and I explained the whole situation and he said, “I only asked because my wife works at a different studio that is a competitor and I’ve heard they are snakes. Linda is a total bitch.”** So yeah, that’s what working with the Kidz Bop people is like. \n\nTl;dr Kidz Bop is run by shady ass scam artists who trample on others to make their buck. I’ve got plenty of documents to back me up on this one that I am willing to share. World should know how corrupt they are",
